this template creates 'slurping' beans out of csv files.  
slurping means the following: these beans take a property
map and offer the defined values as getters.

this is interesting in those cases where you want to be able
to deal with missconfigurations (e.g. the user misstyped a
property) and we wan't to give proper feedback as to what
is available and what not.

jeannie uses this feature extensively.
